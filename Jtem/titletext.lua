Half truths. To put it simply, lies. And yet in all the known universe, between here and the Far Lands, the legend of the Order of the Stone endures, unabridged, as self-evident fact. Indeed, it is only a troubled land that has need for heroes - and ours was fortunate to have, so long ago, four heroes such as these: Gabriel the Warrior, before whose sword all combatants would tremble. Ellegaard the Redstone Engineer, whose machines would spark an era of invention. Magnus the Rogue, who would channel his destructive creativity for the benefit of all. And Soren the Architect, Builder of Worlds and leader of the Order of the Stone. These FOUR friends together, would give so much to gain their rightful place as FOUR heroes. Their greatest quest would take them on a dangerous journey to fight a mysterious creature known as the Ender Dragon. In the end, the Order of the Stone emerged victorious and the dragon was defeated. Their story complete, they slipped away into the pages of legends.",
