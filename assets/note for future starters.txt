hello this is aikoyori from jtem (i know i said i didn't do anything but shhhh)

so i haveth this `assets_scaler.py` right here and it does all the scaling you need for 2x you just need to put everything in 1x 
and everything will be scaled to 2x automatically without the ugly :( shadowy border

all you need to do is install python, pillow and run the script

to install python go to https://python.org and download latest release

on Windows you should be able to just run
`py -m pip install Pillow`
to install Pillow. this is the imaging library that the script uses
then run the script with
`py ./assets_scaler.py`


full credits to Firch of Bunco fame for this :3 (at least i think the script is from them i found it on balala server)
