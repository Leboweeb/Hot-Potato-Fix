Look in aaaageneral.lua for stuff that we want loading before our other content (todo: make this portable)

Nursery.lua and black_market.lua contain our shop tabs

team_packs.lua has the team packs we add.

rescore.lua has lily's rescoring code, im not sure where it gets used if at all

Nothing else should be necessary for other teams to know about (hopefully)
