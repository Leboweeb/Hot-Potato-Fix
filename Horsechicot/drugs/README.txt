we never implemented this because we're busy impregnating jokers and harvesting their children

anwyays. TODO: if anyone wants to implement this themselves, concept is: consumables that get you "addicted", that have temporary quantitative effects (like extra hands, hand size)
but become addictive over time (as in, you get a negative version of that drugs effect if you go too long without consuming more drugs)
they were gonna be available in the black market (see black_market.lua)
