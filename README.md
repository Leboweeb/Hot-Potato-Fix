# It's your turn to add to Hot Potato!

### As a reminder, there are a few rules you must follow for this event:
1. You and your team can only do work on your contributions during your one-week period. You are not allowed to make edits before or after your week period
2. Your access to the repo will be revoked 30 minutes before the next team gets their turn to add to the mod. This will happen around 15:30 UTC
3. You are not allowed to remove features implemented by teams before you. Editing the code of a feature is fine, but removing it or changing its function to be unrecognizable is prohibited
4. Communication between developers not within your team is strictly prohibited outside of critical bugfixing. Because of this, commenting your code is highly encouraged!
5. Using JokerForge or generating assets with AI is not allowed! You must manually create/code your contributions (with an exception for custom sound effects)
6. Using external libraries (outside of Steamodded and cross-mod support) is not allowed
7. This mod is not to be developed with Talisman in mind
8. No NSFW or griefing in the mod whatsoever. Just because you can add “anything” doesn’t mean you can be absolutely stupid with it

### There are also a few standards that should be followed
1. Credits - The base repo comes with credits implementation similar to Cryptid's. These can be implemented for your objects with the following format:
```
hotpot_credits = {
  art = {"string"},
  idea = {"string"},
  code = {"string"},
  team = {"string"}
}
```
2. File loading - Files will be loaded automatically via recursive indexing. It is highly recommended you and your team makes a folder containing all of the lua files your team creates. Lovely files should be prefixed with some sort of identifier as well


Best of luck with your time, and most importantly, have fun! If any problems come up, please contact Astra and it will be looked into as soon as possible
